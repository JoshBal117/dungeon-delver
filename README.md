# ⚔️ Dungeon Delver

A browser-based tactical RPG inspired by *Shining Force*, *Darkest Dungeon*, and *Final Fantasy Tactics*.  
Built in **React + TypeScript + Zustand**, this project began as a learning exercise and evolved into a growing game prototype focused on **progression, persistence, and fast, replayable dungeon combat.**

---

## 🧠 Concept

**Dungeon Delver** follows a lone Knight delving through cursed dungeons that bleed into the surface world.  
Each battle tests your strategy and endurance — survive long enough to grow stronger, unlock new allies, and push deeper into the dark.
