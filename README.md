# ⚔️ Dungeon Delver

A browser-based tactical RPG inspired by *Shining Force*, *Darkest Dungeon*, and *Final Fantasy Tactics*.  
Built in **React + TypeScript + Zustand**, this project began as a learning exercise and evolved into a growing game prototype focused on **progression, persistence, and fast, replayable dungeon combat.**

---

## 🧠 Concept

**Dungeon Delver** follows a lone Knight delving through cursed dungeons that bleed into the surface world.  
Each battle tests your strategy and endurance — survive long enough to grow stronger, unlock new allies, and push deeper into the dark.

## 🎮 Current Features (v0.1 Prototype)

- 🧍 **Knight Hero** — A balanced fighter with scaling stats and XP-based progression.  
- ⚔️ **Turn-Based Combat** — Player vs enemy, with variance and damage rolls.  
- 💾 **Save System** — XP, levels, and hero stats persist via Zustand + localStorage.  
- 🧮 **XP Scaling** — Diminishing XP returns for low-level foes.  
- 📱 **Mobile Friendly** — Adaptive layout and larger touch targets.  
- 🔄 **GitHub Pages Deployment** — Auto-build and deploy via CI/CD workflow.

- 🎒 **Inventory System** — Equip items, armor, and consumables.  
- 🧙‍♂️ **Magic System** — Add MP-based skills and elemental effects.  
- 🧟 **New Enemies** — Expand enemy types and group encounters.  
- 🌄 **Dungeon Progression** — Chain battles into multi-stage runs with rewards.
